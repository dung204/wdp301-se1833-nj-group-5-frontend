## 3. Project Setup

1. Clone this repository or click the "Use this template" button on GitHub to create a new repository.

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

> Note: the `--frozen-lockfile` flag ensures that the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is not modified during installation. This is useful for CI/CD environments where you want to ensure that the exact same dependencies are installed every time.

3.

4. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application in action.

## 4. Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a tool for developing UI components in isolation. It allows you to create, develop and test components without having to run the entire application.

While this documentation site is primarily for setting up the project, Storybook documentation focuses on the design system, UI components, and other frontend aspects (i18n, a11y, etc.).

Storybook is run separately from the main application, so you need to start it in a separate terminal, using the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev:storybook
```

This will start the Storybook server on [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).
